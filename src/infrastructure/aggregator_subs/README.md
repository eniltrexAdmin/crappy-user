This folder is to add subscriber logic, or try to with rust.
First is for the aggregators, to subscribe to the message store, and keep polling.
Poll and send messages to the application -> aggregator

But this can be changed to also the command handlers to keep polling for commands if I were to save the 
commands. This is an option but I don't think I am gonna do that. Maybe next project, when I feel more comfortable.
